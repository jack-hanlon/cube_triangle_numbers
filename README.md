# Triangle Numbers Predict Cube Volume for Integer-Length Cubes

When doing math for fun, I noticed a pattern in the volume of integer-length cubes. The volume difference is equal to 6*T(n) + 1, where T(n) is the triangle number, n = 0,1,2...
<p>
For example:
<p>
1x1x1 cube has vol = 1 --> 6T(0) + 1  = 6(0) + 1  = 1
<p>   
2x2x2 cube has vol  = 8 --> 6T(1) + 1 = 6(1) + 1 = 7  (8-1 = 7)
<p>
3x3x3 cube has vol = 27 --> 6T(2) + 1 = 6(3) + 1 = 19 (27-8 = 19)
<p>
4x4x4 cube has vol = 64 --> 6T(3) + 1 = 6(6) + 1 = 37 (64-27 = 37)
<p>
And so on...

I noticed there were some similar math concepts on this topic out there but I have not seen an identical example of this despite this perhaps being a trivial concept.
